A better version of Jack Douthett and Peter Steinbach's Cube Dance diagram (1998).

Improvements:
- Cubes are not brutalized anymore.
- Laid out in 3D space instead of that out-of-this-world mess the original diagram used and couldn't wrap my head around.
- Jazz chord symbols.
- Better displays the reflectional and rotational symmetry of the diagram.
